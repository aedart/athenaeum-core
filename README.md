# Athenaeum Core

The Athenaeum Core Application is a custom implementation of [Laravel's Foundation Application](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/6.x/src/Illuminate/Contracts/Foundation/Application.php).

It offers the following features:

- Registration and booting of [Service Providers](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/providers)
- Laravel's [Service Container](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/container)
- Laravel's [Configuration Repository](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/configuration)
- Laravel's [Event Dispatcher](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/events)
- Laravel's [Cache Repository](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/cache)
- Laravel's [Console Application](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/artisan) (_lightweight version of Artisan_)
- Exception Handling (_optional_)
